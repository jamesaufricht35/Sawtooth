[We open on the inside of community centre: wood panelling, fluorescent lighting, and uncomfortable chairs lined up in neat rows. We're in Texas. THE PREACHER is already midway through his sermon, standing tall in front of a confederate flag.] 

THE PREACHER
It's only the Western world, and only recently, that those who have built something great, have been asked to hand it over to those who have leeched off of it. Your fathers, and forefathers, and the men many generations before created this civilization. The gold standard of prosperity, decency, ingenuity and creativity. Thousands of years ago, even before Christ was around to guide us, our way of life was propped up in Greece. A castle sticking out of a bog. Decade upon decade, century upon century, across Europe and then into North America, we build upon this castle. Outsiders saw the lights shining in our castle, and they wanted in. They knew they were not worthy, and they wanted in. They knew they had nothing to add... [ to a drunk in the second row] please sir, just have a seat, I don't mind imbibing, but you may have teetered a little far... they knew they had nothing to add, but they wanted in. And some of ours, looked at their dirty children, and failed to overcome their empathy, which is a weakness. This is how Rome fell. England, the world's great empire for centuries, a shadow of itself. They fell because they let weak-willed people take the reins. And when a weak person sees another weak person, what do they see? An equal. And so began the cycle of decline. It's not inevitable, but it is difficult to fight. And fight we must, and fight we will. 

[RICKI AND ROBYN ENTER THE TENT, AND TAKE A SEAT NEAR THE BACK. RICKI STANDS UP] 

RICKI 
Excuse me sir? 

THE PREACHER 
Yes, miss. 

RICKI 
I've got a message from your wife. 

THE PREACHER 
Well, my wife is right here. In the first row. 

RICKI 
Sorry, your first wife. 

THE PREACHER 
You must be mistaken. Got lucky the first time. 

RICKI 
Back when you lived in Cincinnati. Juanita, your first wife? 

THE PREACHER 
Miss, you must be confused. I have not been to Cincinnati. 

RICKI 
Why are you lying to me? 

THIRD ROW MAN 
Shut up, bitch! 

THE PREACHER 
No need for that, friend. Miss, I certainly have never had relations with anyone who has a name like that, believe. Do you know much about me? 

RICKI 
I know a lot about you. You were a mechanic named Joel Schwartz who skipped town on his Mexican wife and daughter because a couple charges got a little too close for comfort. You laid low for a few years and now here you are, moonlighting as a racist. 

THE PREACHER 
Remove her, this is outrageous. Listen, men, there are some among us who are simply mysoginist. I am not. But, do not, ever, let a woman besmirch your name. 

[Two men come up to her] 

RICKI [to the men] 
You fellas want to know what the charges are. 

MAN 1
Shut up. 

RICKI 
Molestation. 

MAN 2
Miss, let's go. 

RICKI 
He was twelve. 

MAN 1
Bitch, come on now. 

RICKI 
His name was Justin. 

[MAN 2 IS HESITATING] 

RICKI 
Google Joel Schwartz, Cincinnati. 

THE PREACHER 
Why are you hesitating, get her out of here. 

RICKI 
What's the first hit? Sex offender registry? 

THE PREACHER 
Alright, I'll eject you myself. 

RICKI 
Have you seen the photo yet? He's younger, new hair, but you can see the likeness in his eyes. 

[MAN 2 LOOKS OVER AT THE SCREEN] 

MAN 2 
Son of a bitch. 

MAN 1 
Lady, who are you. 

RICKI 
Just trying to purge the movement of impurities.

[THE PREACHER GETS A LOOK AT THE PHOTO] 

THE PREACHER 
What fabrication! These photos have been manipulated! Apprehend these women, they must be moles! 

[MAN 1] 
Alright, let's all just calm down. Grab those two, grab him. We'll figure this out. 

PREACHER'S WIFE 
What the hell are you doing, let go of my husband. 

MAN 1 
Grab her too, I guess. 

[Four or five people huddle over the phone. Then they talk for a bit. Man 2 then pulls out his pistol, turns around, and shoot the Preacher in the head. Chaos erupts. Man 1 stands up.] 

MAN 1 
Everyone calm down! This is under control! Just listen- 

[He is shot. Gun fire begins in earnest. We settle on Ricki and Robin making a break for the exit. They get out of the main doors, and where many are taking a left turn, they take a right].
